# font-x-size
This is a small polyfill library for a set of CSS properties revolving around font x-height, to demonstrate the  usefulness of setting font size directly using x-height instead of font body size.

This is an extention of the thread on CSSWG: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6709
